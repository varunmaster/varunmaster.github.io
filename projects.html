		<p>Some of my personal projects include setting up my home network with multiple servers and a network switch running simultaneously.
			<br />Theses servers run multiple VM's which run on top of ESXi hypervisor host.
			<br />Within the ESXi host, I am running a Windows 7 VM which is used for FTP, Plex Server, <a href="http://74.102.92.146:80">my personal website</a> (still under construction), and an API that I created using Node.JS.
			<br />The API currently has 2 nodes, one of which lists all of the movies that I currently own and is on the <a href="http://74.102.92.146:32400">Plex server.</a> The API can be found <a href="http://74.102.92.146:8080/listmovies">here.</a>
			<br />On the same ESXi node, I currently have installed Windows Server 2012 R2 VM, where I am still learning and practicing with IIS.
			<br />Another VM runs an Ubuntu OS that hosts PiHole, which is used as a network-wide AdBlock/DNS to prevent unwanted ads from entering the network and collecting unwanted user data.
