		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I am a self-taught programmer. I graduated from Rutgers University New Brunswick in 2017 with a Bachelor of Science.
			<br />My major Business Analytics and Information Technology (B.A.I.T. for short).
			<br />This major mainly consisted to Statistics mixed in with IT.
			<br />Currently, I work in Jersey City for a software company where I work with the Client-Support team.
			<br />I have created several tools using C# and PowerShell to make the workload easier.
			<br />I am familiar with the following languages and technologies:
			<ul class="myListStyle">
				<li>C#</li>
				<li>SQL (SQL Server)</li>
				<li>PowerShell</li>
				<li>VB.Net</li>
				<li>Java</li>
			</ul>
			<br />Some of my personal projects include setting up my home network with 2 servers and a switch running simultaneously.
			<br />The servers run multiple VM's which run on top of ESXi hypervisor.
			<br />Within the ESXi host, I am running a Windows 7 VM which is used for FTP, Plex Server, personal website (still under construction), and an API that I created.
			<br />The API currently only has 2 nodes. One of which is all the movies that I currently own and is on the Plex server. It can be found <a href="http://74.102.8.240:8080/listmovies">here.</a>
			<br />The website can found <a href="http://74.102.8.240:80">here.</a>
			<br />Another VM runs an Ubuntu OS that hosts PiHole, which is used as a network-wide AdBlock/DNS to prevent un-wanted ads from even entering the network.
