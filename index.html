		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I am a self-taught programmer. I graduated from Rutgers University New Brunswick in 2017.</p>
		<p>I majored in Business Analytics and Information Technology (B.A.I.T. for short).</p>
		<p>This major mainly consisted to Statistics mixed in with IT.</p>
		<p>Currently, I work in Jersey City for a software company where I work with the Client-Support team.</p>
		<p>I have created several tools using C# and PowerShell to make the workload easier.</p>
		<p>I am familiar with the following languages and technologies:</p>
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
				<li>C#</li>
				<li>SQL (SQL Server)</li>
				<li>PowerShell</li>
				<li>VB.Net</li>
				<li>Java</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Some of my personal projects include setting up my home network with 2 servers and a switch running simultaneously.</p>
		<p>The servers run multiple VM's which run on top of ESXi hypervisor.</p>
		<p>Within the VM's I am running a Windows 7 VM which is used for FTP, Plex Server, and personal website (still under construction).</p>
		<p>Another VM runs an Ubuntu OS running PiHole, which is used as a network-wide AdBlock/DNS.</p>
