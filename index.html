		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I am a self-taught programmer. I graduated from Rutgers University New Brunswick in 2017.
			<br />I majored in Business Analytics and Information Technology (B.A.I.T. for short).
			<br />This major mainly consisted to Statistics mixed in with IT.
			<br />Currently, I work in Jersey City for a software company where I work with the Client-Support team.
			<br />I have created several tools using C# and PowerShell to make the workload easier.
			<br />I am familiar with the following languages and technologies:
			<br />
			<ul class="myListStyle">
				<li>C#</li>
				<li>SQL (SQL Server)</li>
				<li>PowerShell</li>
				<li>VB.Net</li>
				<li>Java</li>
			</ul>
				Some of my personal projects include setting up my home network with 2 servers and a switch running simultaneously.
			<br />The servers run multiple VM's which run on top of ESXi hypervisor.
			<br />Within the VM's I am running a Windows 7 host which is used for FTP, Plex Server, and personal website (still under construction).
			<br />Another VM runs an Ubuntu OS that hosts PiHole, which is used as a network-wide AdBlock/DNS.
			<br />One of my many strengths is that I am eager to learn new technologies and take the initiative to learn and excel at it.
			<br />I am willing to do the proper research and find the proper resources to become better at it.
