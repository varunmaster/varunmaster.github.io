				<p>I am a programmer who graduated from Rutgers University New Brunswick in 2017 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Analytics and Information Technology (B.A.I.T.).
					<br />I work in Jersey City for a software company where I am on the Client-Support team.
					<br />While here, I have created several tools using C# and PowerShell to facilitate the flow of the company.
					<br />One of which is a image scanner desktop application which provides a GUI for users to use to load in images and an output area where the it displays the text within a image.
					<br />I am proficient with the following languages and technologies:
					<br />
					<ul class="myListStyle">
						<li>C# </li>
						<li>.Net Framework</li>
						<li>SQL (Microsoft SQL Server)</li>
						<li>PowerShell</li>
						<li>VB(.Net)</li>
						<li>IIS</li>
						<li>Java</li>
						<li>JavaScript</li>
						<li>HTML</li>
						<li>CSS</li>
					</ul>
					<br />
					<br />Outside of the IT world, I am also a powerlifter. I have yet to compete in a professional competition (or any competition for that matter), but after many years of hard-work, I am part of the 1000 pound club.
					<br />My current 1 rep maxes for the bench, squat, and deadlifts are 280, 410, 415 respectively (in lbs.). My future goal is to continue the strength traning and continue to improve myself and become part of the 1200 pound club.
					<br />
					<br />Outside of the gym I am also a big foodie. I love trying new and interesting cuisines. My favorite is Japanese cuisine because of how different they can make one particular dish (such as sushi) and how it is presented. 
					<br />As being a huge foodie, my favorite event is Smorgasburg in New York where many different restaurants of all types of cuisines give you their best food and you get to taste a little bit of the world that is around you.
