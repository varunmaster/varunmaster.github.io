		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I am a self-taught programmer who graduated from Rutgers University New Brunswick in 2017 with a Bachelor of Science
			<br />in Business Analytics and Information Technology (B.A.I.T.).
			<br />I work in Jersey City for a software company where I am on the Client-Support team.
			<br />I have created several tools using C# and PowerShell to facilitate the flow of the company.
			<br />I am proficient with the following languages and technologies:
			<ul class="myListStyle">
				<li>C# (with .Net Framework)</li>
				<li>SQL (SQL Server)</li>
				<li>PowerShell</li>
				<li>VB.Net</li>
				<li>Java</li>
			</ul>
			<br />Some of my personal projects include setting up my home network with servers and a switch running simultaneously.
			<br />Theses servers run multiple VM's which run on top of ESXi hypervisor.
			<br />Within the ESXi host, I am running a Windows 7 VM which is used for FTP, Plex Server, <a href="http://74.102.8.240:80">my personal website</a> (still under construction), and an API that I created.
			<br />The API currently has 2 nodes, one of which lists all of the movies that I currently own and is on the <a href="74.102.8.240:32400">Plex server.</a> The API can be found <a href="http://74.102.8.240:8080/listmovies">here.</a>
			<br />Another VM runs an Ubuntu OS that hosts PiHole, which is used as a network-wide AdBlock/DNS to prevent unwanted ads from entering the network.
